# Dialysis-Monitoring-System
The main motto of this project is to remotely monitor the dialysis process of the patient who is in need of this process. 
Through this application, the
patient blood temperature, the volume of blood flows through the inlet chamber of dialysis, blood outflow from the dialysis chamber and finally the weight is
monitored. 
Also the corresponding parameters are monitored locally though LCDdisplay (16x2) for the physical monitoring of the dialysis process.

 Monitoring Parameters<br />
 1. Patient blood temperature.<br />
 2. The volume of blood flows through the inlet chamber of dialysis.<br />
 3. Blood outflow from the dialysis chamber<br />
 4. Bubble formation in blood flow tubes.<br />

Flow sensor consists of a plastic valve body, a rotor, and a hall-effect sensor.
When liquid flows through the rotor, rotor rolls. Its speed changes with different rate of flow. The hall-effect sensor outputs the corresponding pulse signal. This one is suitable to detect flow of liquid in many applications. There is a comprehensive line of flow sensors in different diameters.

YF-S201 is a flow measurement sensor with high-grade quality sealing property. It works on the Hall Effect principle and with a flow rate range of
